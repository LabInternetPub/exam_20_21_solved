TODO 7: Don't worry you won't need to touch the front-end
    This is a form that performs the login. When the user logs in correctly, the jwt token in stored in the local storage handled by the browser.
    From this moment on, the token can be retrieved from the storage and added to the authorization header to perform new calls to the API (via javascript).
    Note that if you call the loginform.html in your browser and login with the default values, you'll be able to see the token from the
    browser console with the sentence: localStorage.getItem('token');

    Right now, it is working if called through the localhost as: http://localhost:8080/loginform.html
    You must make it work also when called from the file system (or any other origin). For example go the your file browser, navigate to
    yourproject/src/static/ and double-click the loginform.html file. Right now, it is not working when called from the file system
    due to CORS issues.
    You need to configure the cors to make it work!! (maybe in more than one file)
